Prompt:
I'm working on an audio transcription web application using Vue.js, and I need assistance in continuing its development. The application currently supports file uploading, audio preprocessing (including conversion to MP3), chunking, transcription using the Groq API, and basic UI elements for control and display.
I've uploaded the current versions of index.html, app.js, audioProcessing.js, and styles.css to the knowledge base, along with any relevant documentation.
Please review these files and provide guidance on the following:

Identify any potential improvements or optimizations in the existing code.
Suggest the next steps for enhancing the application's functionality, particularly focusing on:
a. Improving error handling and user feedback
b. Enhancing the audio preprocessing pipeline
c. Implementing the minutes generation feature
d. Refining the UI/UX
Provide code snippets or full implementations for any suggested improvements or new features.

Please ensure that your suggestions and code maintain compatibility with the existing structure and Vue.js implementation. If you need any clarification or additional information about the current state of the project, please ask.
